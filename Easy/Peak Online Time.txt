Peak Online Time

Question : You are given a dataset from Amazon that tracks and aggregates user activity on their platform in certain time periods. For each device type, find the time period with the highest number of active users.The output should contain 'user_count', 'time_period', and 'device_type', where 'time_period' is a concatenation of 'start_timestamp' and 'end_timestamp', like ; "start_timestamp to end_timestamp".

Solution:
SELECT 
device_type, 
CONCAT(start_timestamp," to ",end_timestamp) AS bb, 
user_count FROM (
	SELECT * , 
	dense_rank() over(
		partition by device_type 
		ORDER BY user_count DESC) AS rank_dense1 
	FROM user_activity) 
AS v where rank_dense1=1;
