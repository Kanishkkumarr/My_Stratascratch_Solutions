Movie Duration Match

Question : As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazon’s airline partners. Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.
The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."

Solution :

SELECT F.flight_id, E.movie_id,E.duration 
FROM 
flight_schedule AS F JOIN entertainment_catalog AS E
WHERE E.duration<F.flight_duration AND F.flight_id = 101
;
